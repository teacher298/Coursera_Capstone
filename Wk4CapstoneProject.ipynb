    "Consider being someone who would like to move to Toronto or invest in real estate within the Greater Toronto Area, it is often a challenge to identify where the best place buy is. Purchasing real estate is often a big investment and takes up a considerable amount of ones savings. A lot of exploration and research is needed to be able to make an informed decision. Two major consideration factors often involved in real estate purchases are the quality of living within the neighborhood as well as its' housing price \"attractive\"-ness (especially if the area is undervalued).\n",

    "### Toronto neighborhoods with the Best Quality of Life vs Price\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Quality of Life\" is an abstract term. For different people, this can mean different things. In our evaluation, we will take the number of venues within a neighborhood to determine a \"Quality of Life\" index. Within this index, we will consider the number of essential venues within walking distance of the neighborhood. These venues are defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Medical Centre (4bf58dd8d48988d104941735)\n",
    "* Shop & Service (4d4b7105d754a06378d81259)\n",
    "* Restaurant/Food (4d4b7105d754a06374d81259)\n",
    "* Outdoor & Recreation (4d4b7105d754a06377d81259)\n",
    "* Arts & Entertainment (4d4b7104d754a06370d81259)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Housing price\" can vary depending on various factors. This includes many factors such as its' size, type of housing, number of bedrooms, whether it has a garden, etc. As a result, housing prices between neighborhoods can vary greatly based on the type of housing built. To get a better appreciation of how \"Attactive\" a neighborhood is, we attempt to compare how high the demand for housing is. This takes into consideration factors such as how quickly a listing is sold and how easy it is to sell above the asking price.\n",
    "\n",
    "By cross referencing the \"Quality of Life\" for a neighborgood against the \"Attractive\"-ness, we can better understand and recommend where the best place to settle in Toronto is."
